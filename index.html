Put in the bag things that will help you during the first days after moving. Remember that <b>you will not be able to repack boxes immediately</b>. The most important things for that first day should be in your essential bag.</p>
                <h3>Always have with you snacks and water</h3>
                <p>You will make stops for food; it is for sure. However, you should have snacks and water on hand, since you cannot know what will happen on the road. You can easily find yourself in the middle of the traffic jam. It is essential to have water, especially if you travel with pets and children.</p>
                <h3>Clothes</h3>
                <p>No matter how long you will travel, you will need to change clothes. You will surely <b>sweat or get dirty when loading the truck</b>. Spare T-shirt or pants will not take a lot of space. However, they make a huge difference.</p>
                <h3>Essentials for your pet and children</h3>
                <p>In case you travel with pets or children, you surely have essential bags for them. You know that both could feel bored or hungry on long trips. Also, <b>prepare a spare wardrobe and favorite toy for them</b>.</p>
